        One of the standout features of the spreadsheet is the support for
        formulas, which are central to the functionality of any spreadsheet
        application. In this application, formulas begin with an{' '}
        <Code>&quot;=&quot;</Code> sign and can reference other cell values as
        part of mathematical expressions, utilizing operators like{' '}
        <Code>+</Code>, <Code>-</Code>, <Code>*</Code>, and
        <Code>/</Code>. For example, if cell <Em>A1</Em> contains the value{' '}
        <Code>5</Code>, setting cell <Em>A2</Em> to <Code>=A1*2</Code> would
        display <Code>10</Code> in <Em>A2</Em>. If the value in <Em>A1</Em> is
        later updated to <Code>20</Code>, <Em>A2</Em> automatically updates to{' '}
        <Code>20</Code>. This is a core concept of <Strong>reactivity</Strong>,
        where changes in one part of the system propagate automatically to
        dependent parts.

      <Text mb="4" as="p" size="3">
        I utilized a <Strong>graph data structure</Strong> to track dependencies
        between cells. This structure makes it possible to efficiently handle
        updates, ensuring that when one cell changes, only the cells dependent
        on that change are recalculated. However, if there are{' '}
        <Strong>cyclic dependencies</Strong> (e.g., cells referencing each other
        in a loop), an <Strong>ERROR</Strong> message is displayed in the
        relevant cells. An <Strong>ERROR</Strong> message also gets displayed on
        an invalid mathematical expression.

        A key design choice was making the spreadsheet component{' '}

        styling. Instead, the consumer of the component provides the necessary
        styles, labels, and behaviors using a{' '}

        During development, I encountered some performance issues with cell
        re-renders. Every time an update was made, all cells would re-render,
        leading to sluggish performance in larger spreadsheets. By utilizing the
        React Profiler in{' '}
        <Link href="https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools">
          React dev tools

        , I was able to identify the problem areas and apply memoization
        techniques to reduce unnecessary re-renders. This significantly improved
        performance, ensuring that only the cells affected by a change were
        re-rendered, keeping the application responsive even with many cells.
