# 7GUIs

Welcome to **7GUIs**, an exploration of building the classic [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) tasks using **Redux** as the primary data layer and **React** (with React Native) as the view layer‚Äîfully embracing the concept of ‚Äú[UI as an afterthought](https://michel.codes/blogs/ui-as-an-afterthought)‚Äù by prioritizing domain logic first and letting the UI layer ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù to that logic.

---

## 1. Summary of Project üìñ

1. **7GUIs Overview**
   The 7GUIs tasks‚Äî**Counter**, **Temperature Converter**, **Flight Booker**, **Timer**, **CRUD**, **Circle Drawer**, and **Cells**‚Äîprovide a solid baseline for comparing GUI frameworks. Our approach:

   - Builds robust business logic in Redux (the data layer).
   - Reduces UI-specific logic in React/React Native.
   - Ensures a clear separation of concerns‚Äî**Redux** for state, **React** for rendering.

2. **Philosophy: ‚ÄòUI as an Afterthought‚Äô**

   - Inspired by [Michel Weststrate‚Äôs blog post](https://michel.codes/blogs/ui-as-an-afterthought), we first create all necessary domain logic and Redux slices in **`packages/state`**.
   - Only afterward do we assemble the **React** and **React Native** view, hooking them into the already-functional Redux data.
   - This results in a single source of truth for app logic.

3. **Monorepo Structure**
   - **apps/**
     - **web/**: The React + Vite web client implementing the 7GUIs tasks in the browser.
     - **mobile/**: An Expo-based React Native client, illustrating how the same data logic can power mobile.
   - **packages/**
     - **state/**: All Redux slices (domain logic) for the 7 tasks, with minimal/no UI entanglement.

## 2. How to Use ü§ì

### 2.1 Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamvictorli/7gui.git
cd 7gui
pnpm install
```

### 2.2 Build the State Layer

Before running any UI, make sure the **state** package is built or actively compiled. You can do this in watch mode:

```bash
pnpm dev:state
```

This ensures that the shared Redux logic is properly compiled and ready for web or mobile consumers. (You may leave this running in a separate terminal for active development.)

### 2.3 Running the Web App

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

- Opens at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Navigate to any of the 7 tasks via the homepage links.

### 2.3 Running the Mobile App (Expo)

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile
```

- Launches the Expo dev server for React Native.
- Scan the QR code for Expo go or run in an emulator.

### 2.4 Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```

- Uses **Vitest** + **React Testing Library** for thorough coverage.
- Business logic slices are in `packages/state`; UI tests are in `apps/web/app/components/guis`.

### 2.5 Production Builds

- **Web**: `pnpm -F web build` (outputs to `apps/web/build`)
- **Preview**: `pnpm -F web preview`

## 3. Tech Info ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Redux as Data Layer**

   - The **Redux Toolkit** slices in `packages/state` hold all domain logic.
   - Each 7GUIs task has its own slice for clarity.
   - Minimal UI logic: Components purely dispatch actions and select slices.

2. **React & React Native as View Layers**

   - React (web) or React Native (mobile) observes the Redux store.
   - This ‚ÄúUI as an afterthought‚Äù approach cuts down on duplication and potential for logic errors‚Äîmultiple platforms, one consistent state layer.

3. **Modern Tooling**

   - **Vite** for bundling the web client.
   - **Expo** for the mobile client.
   - **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI** for accessible and declarative styling.
   - **Vitest** for fast, modern testing.

4. **Folder Layout**

   - `apps/web` ‚Üí web UI (React)
   - `apps/mobile` ‚Üí mobile UI (React Native)
   - `packages/state` ‚Üí Redux slices, actions, and selectors for each GUI.

5. **Extend & Scale**
   - Adding more tasks or deeper functionalities is straightforward‚Äîadd or extend Redux slices, then surface them in the UI.
   - The domain logic remains consistent, tested, and platform-agnostic.
